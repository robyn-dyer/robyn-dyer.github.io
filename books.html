      <h1>Books</h1>
      <p>Since 2024, reading has become a more intentional part of my routine. 
        While I’ve always enjoyed books, balancing full-time work and school 
        previously left little time for leisure reading. Now, I’ve made space 
        for it—and I couldn’t be happier. Below, you’ll find what I’m currently 
        reading and what I’ve recently finished. Reading is often my escape from 
        screens and a way to enjoy a good fictional story, though I’m equally drawn 
        to books on communication and, more recently, biographies. You can also find me 
        on <a href="https://fable.co/fabler/robyn-198571743000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fable</a>,
        where I track my reading. After trying several reading-tracking apps (the data enthusiast in 
        me can’t resist exploring the analytics), I’ve found Fable to be the most 
        intuitive and enjoyable way to visualize my reading progress. </p>
