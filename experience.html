      <h1>Experience</h1>
      <p>I am focused on building pipelines, warehouses, and dashboards that turn raw data into real decisions.
        I enjoy leveraging the ever evolving AI tools (such as Claude Code) to empower my growth as an engineer and increase
        output so I can focus on the things that drive business and my curiosity the most. I do my best work remotely and have spent my career proving that distributed teams can build extraordinary things.</p>

              <span class="insight-label insight-loved">Loved</span>
              <p class="insight-text">The culture was something rare: a fully remote team that still felt genuinely connected, collaborative, and invested in each other. I had real ownership, made real decisions, and moved fast on things that mattered. My voice was heard and a different perspective was welcomed, not feared. The data team (and the entire Rinsed team) was truly extraordinary. We regularly shared knowledge through Lunch and Learns and Ninety meetings, which kept everyone aligned and learning together. This was my first start-up experience and it set the bar for what I want in every role after.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="insight-card">
              <span class="insight-label insight-learned">Learned</span>
              <p class="insight-text">Rinsed introduced me to DBT and pushed me to use Python scripts, GitHub Actions, and AI tools like Claude to move faster and build better. I learned to programmatically update Metabase dashboards at scale, saving hours of manual work. I competed in a 24-hour hackathon with a team of four to reimagine the data analytics portion of our CRM using Replit, earning second place and a spot on the product roadmap. I also co-lead a full BI tool evaluation, coordinating demos and building a comparison framework for both internal and tenant-facing needs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="insight-card">
              <span class="insight-label insight-impact">Impact</span>
              <p class="insight-text">The impact came from a few directions. During tenant interviews, I flagged a churn risk with an enterprise customer, partnered with the CSM to dig in, and helped resolve it before it became a loss. I led the Stacksync integration connecting HubSpot and Zendesk for real-time two-way sync, owning it from kickoff through documentation and a Lunch and Learn. I built a product status mapping dashboard in Metabase and a DBT model to power it that gave leadership weekly visibility into billing gaps and cross-sell opportunities. I helped serve hundreds of tenants across multiple POS systems, which meant building and maintaining unified data models from sources that rarely aligned.</p>

            <div class="insight-card">
              <span class="insight-label insight-disliked">Never Again</span>
              <p class="insight-text">Rinsed was a place I was genuinely excited to show up for every day. In hindsight, I learned the importance of asking bigger questions earlier about a business’s trajectory. Being laid off unexpectedly reinforced the value of staying curious about the bigger picture, not just the work in front of me.</p>

              <span class="insight-label insight-loved">Loved</span>
              <p class="insight-text">Entertainment data is genuinely fun. I loved tracking a guest's journey from the app to the bay, including wait times, food, and player experience, and working with Toptracer, which uses cameras (not RFID) to track every ball. I was proud to witness my reports being used at venues across the US.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="insight-card">
              <span class="insight-label insight-learned">Learned</span>
              <p class="insight-text">Merging labor data from three non-standardized POS systems into a single model was painstaking work. It tied directly to payroll and timecards, so accuracy wasn't optional. Timestamps are tricky enough on their own, and trickier when each source delivers the data differently.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="insight-card">
              <span class="insight-label insight-impact">Impact</span>
              <p class="insight-text">I owned SSAS cubes relied on by 100+ users daily and surfaced labor data that helped venues run more efficiently. I also aggregated player surveys to give leadership a clearer picture of the guest experience and where to improve.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="insight-card">
              <span class="insight-label insight-disliked">Never Again</span>
              <p class="insight-text">A shifting org structure and a heavy reliance on contractors made ownership feel murky. There was a real tension between getting things done fast and doing them well. Pair that with a lack of leadership transparency, and building genuine buy-in for the right priorities was an uphill battle.</p>

              <span class="insight-label insight-impact">Impact</span>
              <p class="insight-text">I noticed we were showing prices based on assumed location often underpricing users who were actually in a higher tier. I designed and ran a test to capture location earlier in the flow, improving consistency and driving meaningful lift in conversion.</p>
